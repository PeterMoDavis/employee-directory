# Employee Directory

## Description

I built this react app so that an employer could see all their employee's images, names, phone numbers, emails and birth dates listed on one page. By typing in the search bar, the user can filter employees by first name or last name. If the user clicks on the "Name" tab the employees list will be alphabetized by last name. If the user clicks the "DOB" tab the employees list will be sorted by year. While working on this project I furthered my knowledge in the basics of React such as, passing props to components, writing class components vs function components, conditional rendering and utilizing the "sort" and "map" array methods.

## Usage

All you have to do is go to the deployed application [HERE](https://petermodavis.github.io/employee-directory/)
Once at the at the application you can search in the searchbar by first or last name:
![Sort by name](./public/images/name-filter.png)
You can click on the Name tag and they employees will be alphabetized by last name:
![Alphabetized by last name](./public/images/alpha-name.png)
And you can click on the DOB and employees will be sorted by year from oldest to youngest.
